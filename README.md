# 🚀 IncodeVision ML Internship

This repository contains my **task-based work** completed as part of the  
**Machine Learning Internship at IncodeVision**.

The focus of this internship is on building a **strong data foundation** through
data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insight generation
using real-world datasets.

The repository is structured to be **clean, modular, and scalable**, allowing
new tasks and datasets to be added progressively.

## 🧠 Internship Objectives

This internship at **IncodeVision** is designed to provide hands-on experience across
the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle.

Key objectives include:
- Performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on open-source datasets
- Applying feature engineering and preprocessing techniques
- Building supervised learning models for regression and classification
- Evaluating models using appropriate performance metrics
- Visualizing insights and model outputs for interpretability
- Writing clean, readable, and reproducible analytical code

---

## ✅ Tasks Overview

The internship consists of the following tasks, each targeting a core data science or
machine learning concept.

### 🔹 Task 01 – Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ✅
- End-to-end data preprocessing and cleaning
- Datatype correction and feature engineering
- Exploratory analysis to identify trends and patterns
- Sales, profit, discount, region, category, and segment-level insights
- Visualization-driven interpretation using Python libraries
