# 🚀 IncodeVision ML Internship

This repository contains my **task-based work** completed as part of the  
**Machine Learning Internship at IncodeVision**.

The internship focuses on building a **strong data and machine learning foundation**
through data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature
engineering, and predictive modeling using real-world datasets.

The repository is structured to be **clean, modular, and scalable**, allowing
new tasks and datasets to be added progressively.

## 🧠 Internship Objectives

This internship at **IncodeVision** is designed to provide hands-on experience
across the **end-to-end machine learning lifecycle**.

Key objectives include:
- Performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Applying feature engineering and preprocessing techniques
- Handling real-world challenges such as missing data and class imbalance
- Building supervised learning models for regression and classification
- Evaluating models using appropriate performance metrics
- Visualizing insights and model outputs for interpretability
- Writing clean, readable, and reproducible analytical code
